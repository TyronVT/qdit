 * `TASKS.inProgress`, and `dashboard.spec.ts` asserts that same task appears
 * under "My open tasks", which only holds for tasks assigned to whoever is
 * signed in. The two can only both pass if the signed-in user *is* the owner
 * persona, so the real account holds it in the hosted database: the memberships,
 * task assignments, proofs and deployments all sit with it.
 *
 * `supabase/seed.sql` creates "Ada Builder" for that role instead, because it
 * seeds a local stack where there is no real account to hand anything to. That
 * divergence is deliberate; see the e2e section of README.md.
 *
 * Pointing `E2E_EMAIL` at anyone else — including Ada on the hosted project,
 * where she holds no membership — fails ~50 specs on their empty states rather
 * than on sign-in. `web/.env.example` describes the symptom.
